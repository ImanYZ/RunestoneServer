      * Sample code from that chapter is in inclass/session26.py. See especially the exercises at the end, which you should read and get started on before class, so that you can discuss and complete them during class, working with other students.
      * (optional) Read about the `Natural Language ToolKit <http://www.nltk.org/>`_.  (This module will **not** be on the final exam. You are welcome to use it in your projects.)       

   * Before Thursday's class:
      * No special class prep. Work on your projects.
 
#. Turn in the reading response, by 8 PM the night before your registered section meets.

At an aggregate level, rather than an individual level, Weber argues that because open source projects are "antirival" goods, they can survive having only a small fraction of the participants making positive contributions. First, define "antiviral" in your own words. Then say whether you think the same argument would work just as well for a "nonrival" good as for an "antirival" good.
