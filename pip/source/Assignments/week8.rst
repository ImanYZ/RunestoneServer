Reading Response 7
------------------

Briefly define open source software in your own words.

Weber argues that you should be surprised that there is high quality open source software out there and offers some questions/puzzles that he thinks need to be answered in ordered to explain how that has happened. Which of those questions do *you* think really are puzzling, and which, if any, do you think have obvious answers? 

.. actex:: rr_7_2

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   """

Was there anything from this chapter you found confusing? If so, what?
